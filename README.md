# Face Verification Using mmWave FMCW Radars

The aim of this project is to use off-the-shelf FMCW mm-wave radars like the TI IWR1443 for purpose of Face Verification.
There are many advantages to mm-waves including the ability to penetrate many materials usually associated with facial coverings and masks. This also means that its application towards facial profiling and verification is perfect in a post-COVID world. The FMCW radar generates a 3D point cloud which is then passed into a modified PointNet++ machine learning algorithm for classification.

The project serves as a major part towards completing my Masters at Virginia Tech.

All code will be developed on Python and Tensorflow. 

### FMCW Radar
The preprocessing functions are inspired by the open-radar library and will be uploaded soon.


### Model & Dataset
Model and dataset details will be shared later.
